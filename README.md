# JustPaste

JustPaste is a lightweight, customizable Chrome extension that lets you define text expansion shortcuts for commonly used phrases. Create a keyword like `addr` or `sig`, and paste a full message instantly by typing it into almost any input field — no special syntax or slashes required.

## 👉 [Install on the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dhokfeiamfnbhnmhhjaghheekhmdakoi?utm_source=item-share-cb)

## ✨ Features

- Expand keywords into full messages with rich formatting (bold, italics, bullet points, line breaks)
- Works on most standard text fields and contentEditable areas (email, support platforms, etc.)
- Click the popup to paste, or hit <kbd>`</kbd> (backtick) to paste instantly
- All keywords are stored locally in Chrome — no accounts, no syncing
- Friendly interface to add, edit, and search keywords
